description: - When hunting for WMI event subscription persistence (MITRE ATT&CK T1546.003) - After detecting suspicious WMI activity in endpoint telemetry - During incident response to identify attacker persistence mechanisms - When Sysmon alerts trigger on Event IDs 19, 20, or 21 - During purple team exercises testing WMI-based persistence

------|-------------|
| Sysmon Event 19 | WmiEventFilter creation detected |
| Sysmon Event 20 | WmiEventConsumer creation detected |
| Sysmon Event 21 | WmiEventConsumerToFilter binding detected |
| T1546.003 | Event Triggered Execution: WMI Event Subscription |
| CommandLineEventConsumer | Executes system commands when filter triggers |
| ActiveScriptEventConsumer | Runs VBScript/JScript when filter triggers |

## Tools & Systems

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Sysmon | Windows event monitoring for WMI activity |
| WMI Explorer | GUI tool for browsing WMI namespaces |
| Autoruns | Sysinternals tool listing persistence mechanisms |
| PowerShell Get-WMIObject | Enumerate WMI event subscriptions |
| Splunk | SIEM analysis of Sysmon WMI events |
| Velociraptor | Endpoint WMI artifact collection |
