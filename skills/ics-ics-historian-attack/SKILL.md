| OT Historian | Database server (OSIsoft PI, Ignition, Wonderware) storing time-series process data from SCADA/DCS systems |
| Pivot Point | Historian's position between IT and OT networks makes it a prime target for attackers to move between zones |
| Data Replay Attack | Feeding historical data to an HMI to mask real-time process manipulation (Stuxnet technique) |
| OSIsoft PI | Most widely deployed OT historian, used by 65% of Global 500 process companies |
| Ignition | Inductive Automation SCADA platform with historian module, increasingly targeted due to Python scripting capabilities |
| CVE-2025-0921 | Ignition SCADA privileged file system vulnerability allowing escalation through malicious project files |
