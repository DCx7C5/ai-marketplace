description: - When building Docker container images in CI/CD and needing automated vulnerability scanning before registry push - When establishing quality gates that prevent images with critical or high CVEs from reaching production - When compliance requirements mandate vulnerability scanning of all container images before deployment - When scanning IaC files

---|------------|
| CVE | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures — standardized identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities |
| Vulnerability DB | Trivy's regularly updated database aggregating CVE data from NVD, vendor advisories, and language-specific sources |
| Misconfiguration | Security-relevant configuration issue in Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, or IaC templates |
| SBOM | Software Bill of Materials — complete inventory of all components and dependencies in a container image |
| Ignore Unfixed | Flag to skip CVEs without available patches, reducing noise from vulnerabilities with no actionable fix |
| VEX | Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange — machine-readable statements about whether a vulnerability is exploitable in context |
| Exit Code | Non-zero return code from Trivy when findings exceed the severity threshold, used to fail CI/CD pipelines |

## Tools & Systems

- **Trivy**: Open-source vulnerability scanner by Aqua Security supporting images, filesystems, repos, and IaC
- **trivy-action**: Official GitHub Action for running Trivy scans in GitHub Actions workflows
- **Trivy Operator**: Kubernetes operator that continuously scans cluster workloads with Trivy
- **Grype**: Alternative image scanner by Anchore for comparison and validation of scan results
- **Harbor**: Container registry with built-in Trivy integration for automatic image scanning on push

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Multi-Stage Build with Separate Scan and Push

**Context**: A team builds multi-stage Docker images and needs to scan the final production image before pushing to ECR, while also scanning the build stage for supply chain risks.

**Approach**:
1. Build the Docker image with `--target production` for the final stage
2. Run Trivy with `--severity CRITICAL,HIGH --exit-code 1 --ignore-unfixed` to block on exploitable issues
3. Generate an SBOM in CycloneDX format and store as a build artifact
4. Upload SARIF results to GitHub Security tab for visibility
5. Only push to ECR if the Trivy scan exits with code 0
6. Tag the pushed image with the scan timestamp and Trivy DB version for audit traceability

**Pitfalls**: Scanning only the final stage misses vulnerable packages that were present in build stages and may have influenced the build. Run `trivy fs` on the build context separately. Caching the Trivy DB too aggressively (weekly) means newly published CVEs take days to appear in scans.
