---|------------|
| Security Zone | A grouping of logical or physical assets that share common security requirements, as defined by IEC 62443-3-2 |
| Conduit | A logical grouping of communication channels connecting two or more zones, subject to common security policies |
| Security Level Target (SL-T) | The desired security level for a zone, ranging from SL 1 (casual violation) to SL 4 (state-sponsored attack) |
| Data Diode | Hardware-enforced unidirectional network gateway that physically prevents data from flowing in the reverse direction |
| Microsegmentation | Granular network segmentation at the device level, managing communication device-by-device based on roles and functions |
| Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) | Firewall capability to inspect industrial protocol payloads (Modbus function codes, OPC UA service calls) beyond Layer 4 |
| Defense in Depth | Layered security approach where multiple security controls protect assets at different levels of the architecture |

## Tools & Systems

- **Cisco ISA-3000**: Industrial security appliance providing OT-aware firewall, IPS, and VPN capabilities with Modbus, DNP3, and EtherNet/IP inspection
- **Fortinet FortiGate Rugged**: Ruggedized next-gen firewall with OT protocol support for industrial environments
- **Palo Alto IoT/OT Security**: Cloud-delivered OT security subscription providing device identification and protocol-aware policy enforcement
- **Waterfall Security Solutions**: Hardware-enforced unidirectional security gateways (data diodes) for OT-to-IT data transfer
- **Tofino Xenon**: Industrial security appliance providing deep packet inspection for Modbus, OPC, and EtherNet/IP protocols

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Migrating Flat OT Network to Zone Architecture

**Context**: A manufacturing plant operates all OT devices on a single VLAN (10.10.0.0/16) with no segmentation between PLCs, HMIs, historians, and the corporate network. An IEC 62443 gap assessment identified this as a critical finding requiring zone implementation.

**Approach**:
1. Capture complete traffic baseline for 4 weeks using passive monitoring to identify all legitimate communication flows
2. Classify all assets into Purdue levels and group into logical zones based on function and security requirements
3. Design VLAN architecture with one VLAN per zone and inter-zone firewall rules based on observed legitimate traffic
4. Deploy industrial firewalls at zone boundaries with initial "monitor only" mode (log but do not block)
5. Analyze firewall logs for 2 weeks to identify any legitimate traffic that would be blocked
6. Switch firewalls to enforcement mode during a scheduled maintenance window
7. Validate that all process control communications function correctly post-segmentation
8. Implement data diode between operations and DMZ for historian replication

**Pitfalls**: Implementing zone firewalls without a complete traffic baseline will break unknown but legitimate communication paths. Scheduling zone cutover during production instead of maintenance windows risks process disruptions. Placing SIS controllers in the same zone as BPCS violates IEC 62443 safety system isolation requirements.
