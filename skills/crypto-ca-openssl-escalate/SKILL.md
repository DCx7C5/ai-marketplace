| basicConstraints | CA:TRUE/FALSE, pathLenConstraint | Yes |
| keyUsage | keyCertSign, cRLSign, digitalSignature | Yes |

## Security Considerations

- Root CA private key must be stored offline (air-gapped HSM)
- Use minimum 4096-bit RSA or P-384 ECDSA for CA keys
- Set path length constraints on intermediate CAs
- Implement certificate policies (OIDs)
- Enable CRL and OCSP for revocation checking
- Audit all certificate issuance operations

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Root CA self-signed certificate is valid
- [ ] Intermediate CA certificate chains to Root CA
- [ ] Issued certificates chain to Intermediate -> Root
- [ ] Path length constraints are enforced
- [ ] CRL is generated and accessible
- [ ] Revoked certificates appear in CRL
- [ ] Certificate policies are correctly embedded
