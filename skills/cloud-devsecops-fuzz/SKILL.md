## Monitoring Fuzzing Campaigns

```bash
# View fuzzing statistics
afl-whatsup findings/

# Key metrics to track:
# - Total paths found (code coverage indicator)
# - Unique crashes / unique hangs
# - Stability percentage (should be >90%)
# - Exec speed (execs/sec)
# - Cycles done (full corpus cycles completed)
```
