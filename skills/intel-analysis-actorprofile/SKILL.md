| **APT** | Advanced Persistent Threat — well-resourced, sophisticated adversary (typically nation-state or sophisticated criminal) conducting long-term targeted operations |
| **TTPs** | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures — behavioral fingerprint of an adversary group, more durable than IOCs which change frequently |
| **Aliases** | Threat actors receive different names from different vendors (APT29 = Cozy Bear = The Dukes = Midnight Blizzard = YTTRIUM) |
| **Attribution** | Process of associating an attack with a specific threat actor; requires multiple independent corroborating data points and carries inherent uncertainty |
| **Cluster** | A group of related intrusion activity that may or may not be attributable to a single actor; used when attribution is uncertain |
| **Intrusion Set** | STIX SDO type representing a grouped set of adversarial behaviors with common objectives, even if actor identity is unknown |

## Tools & Systems

- **MITRE ATT&CK Groups**: Free, community-maintained database of 130+ documented adversary groups with referenced campaign reports
- **Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence**: Commercial platform with detailed APT profiles, malware families, and campaign analysis
- **CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence**: Commercial feed with adversary-centric profiles and real-time attribution updates
- **Recorded Future Threat Intelligence**: Combines OSINT, dark web, and technical intelligence for adversary profiling
- **OpenCTI**: Graph-based visualization of threat actor relationships, tooling, and campaign linkages

## Common Pitfalls

- **IOC-centric profiles**: Building profiles around IP addresses and domains rather than TTPs means the profile becomes stale within weeks as infrastructure rotates.
- **Vendor alias confusion**: Conflating two different threat actor groups due to shared malware or infrastructure leads to incorrect threat model assumptions.
- **Binary attribution**: Treating attribution as certain when it is probabilistic. Always qualify attribution confidence level (Low/Medium/High).
- **Neglecting insider and criminal groups**: Overemphasis on nation-state APTs while ignoring ransomware groups (Cl0p, LockBit, ALPHV) which represent higher probability threats for most organizations.
- **Profile staleness**: Adversary TTPs evolve. Profiles not updated quarterly may miss technique changes, new malware, or targeting shifts.
