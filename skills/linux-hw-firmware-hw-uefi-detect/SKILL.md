|
| **UEFI Bootkit** | Malware that persists in UEFI firmware or the boot process, executing before the operating system loads and surviving OS reinstallation |
| **SPI Flash** | Serial Peripheral Interface flash memory chip on the motherboard storing UEFI firmware; firmware-level bootkits like LoJax and MoonBounce modify SPI flash contents |
| **EFI System Partition (ESP)** | FAT32 partition containing EFI bootloaders and drivers; bootkits like BlackLotus and ESPecter modify files on the ESP for persistence |
| **Secure Boot** | UEFI security feature that verifies digital signatures of boot components; can be bypassed via vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-21894) or MOK enrollment |
| **DXE Driver** | Driver Execution Environment driver loaded during UEFI boot; firmware implants inject malicious DXE drivers that execute before the OS |
| **Machine Owner Key (MOK)** | User-installable Secure Boot key; BlackLotus enrolls attacker-controlled MOKs to sign malicious bootloaders |
| **chipsec** | Intel platform security assessment framework for analyzing SPI flash, UEFI variables, Secure Boot, and hardware security configurations |
| **HVCI** | Hypervisor-enforced Code Integrity, a Windows security feature that bootkits disable to load unsigned kernel drivers |

## Tools & Systems

- **chipsec**: Intel framework for dumping SPI flash, reading UEFI variables, verifying firmware write protection, and Secure Boot configuration auditing
- **UEFITool**: Open-source UEFI firmware image parser for inspecting firmware volumes, extracting DXE drivers, and comparing module GUIDs
- **sigcheck**: Sysinternals utility for verifying digital signatures of EFI binaries and boot chain components
- **flashrom**: Open-source SPI flash programmer for reading and writing firmware chips on supported platforms
- **YARA**: Pattern matching engine used with UEFI-specific rule sets to detect known bootkit signatures in firmware dumps

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Investigating Persistent Compromise Surviving OS Reinstallation

**Context**: An enterprise endpoint was reimaged after a confirmed breach, but identical C2 beaconing resumed within hours. The endpoint has UEFI firmware with Secure Boot enabled, and a TPM 2.0 chip. The security team suspects a UEFI-level implant similar to BlackLotus or LoJax.

**Approach**:
1. Boot the system from a trusted Linux live USB to avoid executing any compromised OS components
2. Dump SPI flash firmware using `chipsec_util.py spi dump` for offline analysis
3. Mount the ESP and hash all `.efi` files for comparison against known-good values from identical hardware
4. Check for the `ESP:/system32/` directory (BlackLotus indicator) and unauthorized `grubx64.efi`
5. Extract firmware modules with UEFIExtract and compare GUID inventory against vendor baseline
6. Verify Secure Boot variables -- look for unauthorized MOK enrollment or modified db/dbx
7. Check SPI flash write protection and lock bits using chipsec modules
8. Scan firmware dump and extracted modules with UEFI-specific YARA rules
9. If BlackLotus is suspected, check registry for HVCI disabled and MeasuredBoot logs for anomalous entries

**Pitfalls**:
- Running analysis from the compromised OS (rootkit components hide from live analysis)
- Only checking the ESP without examining SPI flash firmware (misses firmware-level implants like LoJax, MoonBounce)
- Assuming Secure Boot prevents all bootkits (CVE-2022-21894 and other bypasses exist)
- Not preserving the original firmware dump before remediation (critical forensic evidence)
- Reflashing firmware without verifying the vendor image is authentic and unmodified
