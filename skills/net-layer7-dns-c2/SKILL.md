|
| **DNS Tunneling** | Technique of encoding data within DNS queries and responses to create a covert communication channel, bypassing firewalls that allow DNS traffic |
| **Shannon Entropy** | Information theory metric measuring randomness in a string; legitimate domains typically have entropy below 3.5, while encoded tunnel data exceeds 3.8-4.5 |
| **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)** | Malware technique that algorithmically generates thousands of pseudo-random domain names for C2 rendezvous, making domain-based blocking impractical |
| **DNS Beaconing** | Regular, periodic DNS queries from a compromised host to a C2 domain, identifiable by consistent inter-query intervals and low timing jitter |
| **TXT Record Abuse** | Using DNS TXT records to deliver encoded C2 commands or staged payloads, exploiting the large payload capacity (up to 65535 bytes across multiple strings) |
| **Iodine** | Open-source DNS tunneling tool that tunnels IPv4 traffic through DNS using NULL, TXT, or CNAME records, commonly used to bypass captive portals |
| **dnscat2** | Encrypted C2 tool that creates a command channel over DNS, supporting file transfer, port forwarding, and shell access through DNS queries |
| **Cobalt Strike DNS Beacon** | Commercial C2 framework's DNS communication mode that uses A, AAAA, and TXT records to receive tasks and return results via DNS resolution |
| **Passive DNS (pDNS)** | Database of historical DNS resolution data collected by monitoring DNS traffic; used to identify infrastructure reuse and domain history |
| **Response Policy Zone (RPZ)** | DNS firewall mechanism that allows real-time blocking of malicious domains by injecting override responses at the recursive resolver level |
| **Coefficient of Variation** | Standard deviation divided by mean, expressed as percentage; used to measure beacon jitter -- lower CV indicates more regular (suspicious) timing |
| **NXDOMAIN** | DNS response code indicating the queried domain does not exist; high NXDOMAIN rates from a host suggest DGA activity where most generated domains are unregistered |

## Tools & Systems

- **Zeek (Bro)**: Network security monitor that produces structured dns.log with query/response details for offline analysis
- **Suricata**: IDS/IPS with DNS protocol parsing and signature-based detection of tunneling patterns
- **tshark/Wireshark**: Packet capture and analysis tools for deep DNS protocol inspection
- **tldextract**: Python library for accurate domain/subdomain extraction using the Public Suffix List
- **dnspython**: Python DNS toolkit for programmatic query resolution and record parsing
- **scikit-learn**: ML library used to train DGA classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- **Farsight DNSDB / CIRCL pDNS**: Passive DNS databases for historical domain resolution lookups
- **DNS Response Policy Zone (RPZ)**: Recursive resolver feature for real-time DNS blocking of identified C2 domains
- **Splunk / Elastic**: SIEM platforms for DNS log aggregation, entropy calculation, and beacon detection queries

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Investigating Suspected DNS Tunneling from an Internal Host

**Context**: The SOC receives an alert from the DNS firewall showing a single internal host (10.1.5.42) making 15,000+ DNS queries to the domain `c8a3f1e2.tunnelsvc.example.com` in the past hour. All queries are TXT type with long, random-looking subdomains. Normal DNS volume for this host is ~200 queries/hour.

**Approach**:
1. Extract all DNS queries from 10.1.5.42 for the past 24 hours from Zeek dns.log
2. Run entropy analysis on subdomain strings -- expect Shannon entropy > 4.0 for encoded tunnel data
3. Check query timing intervals for beaconing pattern (likely sub-second for active tunnel)
4. Examine TXT record responses for size anomalies (tunnel tools use maximum-size TXT responses)
5. Compare subdomain patterns against known tool signatures (Iodine, dnscat2, dns2tcp)
6. Query passive DNS for `tunnelsvc.example.com` registration date, nameserver, and historical resolutions
7. If confirmed, add domain to DNS RPZ blocklist and isolate endpoint via EDR
8. Capture full packet trace for forensic analysis of tunnel payload content

**Pitfalls**:
- Blocking the domain before capturing evidence (need packet captures for forensics)
- Assuming all high-entropy DNS is malicious (CDN subdomains like Akamai can have high entropy)
- Not checking for multiple tunnel domains (attacker may have fallback C2 channels)
- Missing the initial compromise vector by focusing only on the DNS channel
- Not checking other hosts for similar patterns (lateral movement may have already occurred)

### Scenario: Building a DGA Detection Model for SOC Deployment

**Context**: The threat intelligence team identified that a botnet family active in the industry uses DGA for C2 domain generation. The SOC needs an automated way to classify DNS queries as potentially DGA-generated and alert on matches.

**Approach**:
1. Collect training data: Tranco/Alexa top 1M for legitimate domains, DGArchive or OSINT feeds for known DGA domains
2. Extract character-level features: entropy, length, digit ratio, consonant sequences, bigram scores
3. Train Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers, evaluate with 5-fold cross-validation
4. Deploy the model as a scoring enrichment in the SIEM (Splunk ML Toolkit or Elastic ML)
5. Set threshold: DGA probability > 0.85 generates alert, > 0.65 generates investigation ticket
6. Create a whitelist of known high-entropy legitimate domains (CDNs, cloud services) to reduce false positives
7. Retrain monthly with new DGA samples from threat intel feeds

**Pitfalls**:
- Training only on one DGA family and missing others (dictionary-based DGAs like Suppobox have low entropy)
- Not whitelisting CDN and cloud service domains that have randomized subdomains
- Setting the threshold too low, overwhelming the SOC with false positives
- Not accounting for punycode/internationalized domain names in feature extraction
- Deploying without a feedback loop for analysts to flag false positives for model retraining
