---|------------|
| Cold Start | Initial function invocation that includes container provisioning, increasing latency and creating a window where cached secrets may not be available |
| Event Injection | Attack where malicious input is embedded in Lambda event data from API Gateway, S3, SQS, or other event sources to exploit the function |
| Execution Role | IAM role assumed by Lambda during execution, defining all cloud API permissions the function can use |
| Function URL | Direct HTTPS endpoint for Lambda functions that can be configured with IAM or no authentication (NONE is insecure) |
| Layer | Lambda deployment package containing shared code or dependencies that should be scanned for vulnerabilities independently |
| Reserved Concurrency | Maximum number of concurrent executions for a function, useful for preventing resource exhaustion attacks |
| Provisioned Concurrency | Pre-initialized function instances that reduce cold start latency and ensure secrets are cached |

## Tools & Systems

- **AWS Lambda Power Tuning**: Open-source tool for optimizing Lambda memory and timeout settings to balance security with performance
- **Snyk**: SCA tool scanning Lambda dependencies for known vulnerabilities with automatic fix suggestions
- **Semgrep**: SAST tool with serverless-specific rules detecting injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, and insecure configurations
- **GuardDuty Lambda Protection**: AWS service monitoring Lambda network activity for connections to malicious endpoints
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing service for detecting suspicious external connections and latency anomalies in Lambda invocations

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: SQL Injection via API Gateway to Lambda to RDS

**Context**: A Lambda function receives user input from API Gateway and constructs SQL queries by string concatenation against an RDS PostgreSQL database. An attacker injects SQL payloads through the API.

**Approach**:
1. Audit the Lambda function code for string concatenation in SQL queries
2. Replace all string-formatted queries with parameterized queries using the database driver
3. Implement input validation using JSON Schema before any database operation
4. Add a WAF rule on API Gateway to block common SQL injection patterns
5. Deploy Semgrep in the CI/CD pipeline with the `python.django.security.injection.sql` rule set
6. Enable GuardDuty Lambda protection to detect anomalous database connection patterns

**Pitfalls**: Relying solely on WAF rules without fixing the underlying code vulnerability allows attackers to bypass with encoding tricks. Using ORM methods incorrectly (raw queries) still allows injection.
