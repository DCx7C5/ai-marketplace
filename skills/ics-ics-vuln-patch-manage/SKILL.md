description: - When establishing a formal OT patch management program for the first time - When responding to critical ICS-CERT advisories affecting deployed OT systems - When preparing for NERC CIP-007-6 or IEC 62443 patch management compliance audits - When planning patch deployment during limited maintenance windows in continuous operations - When evaluating

---|------------|
| Compensating Control | Alternative security measure applied when a patch cannot be deployed, such as firewall rules, IPS signatures, or network isolation |
| Vendor Compatibility | Confirmation from the OT vendor that a patch (especially OS patches) is compatible with their control system software |
| Maintenance Window | Scheduled period for system modifications, aligned with process shutdowns or reduced-risk operational periods |
| Virtual Patching | Deploying IDS/IPS rules to detect and block exploitation attempts for known vulnerabilities without modifying the target system |
| Evaluation Deadline | NERC CIP-007-6 requires patch evaluation within 35 calendar days of availability |
| Turnaround | Major scheduled shutdown of a process unit for maintenance, providing opportunity for extensive OT patching |

## Tools & Systems

- **WSUS/SCCM**: Microsoft patch management for Windows-based OT systems (HMIs, historians, engineering workstations)
- **Siemens ProductCERT**: Siemens security advisory service for industrial products
- **Claroty xDome**: OT vulnerability management with patch availability tracking and risk scoring
- **Tripwire Enterprise**: Configuration monitoring detecting unauthorized changes and tracking patch status
