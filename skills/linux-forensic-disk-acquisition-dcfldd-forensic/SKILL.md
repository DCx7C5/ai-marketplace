description: - When you need to create a forensic copy of a suspect drive for investigation - During incident response when preserving volatile disk evidence before analysis - When law enforcement or legal proceedings require a verified bit-for-bit copy - Before performing any destructive analysis on a storage device - When acquiring images from physical drives
domain: cybersecurity

------|-------------|
| Bit-for-bit copy | Exact replica of source including unallocated space and slack space |
| Write blocker | Hardware or software mechanism preventing writes to evidence media |
| Hash verification | Cryptographic hash comparing source and image to prove integrity |
| Block size (bs) | Transfer chunk size affecting speed; 4096 or 64K typical for forensics |
| conv=noerror,sync | Continue on read errors and pad with zeros to maintain offset alignment |
| Chain of custody | Documented trail proving evidence has not been tampered with |
| Split imaging | Breaking large images into smaller files for storage and transport |
| Raw/dd format | Bit-for-bit image format without metadata container overhead |

## Tools & Systems

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| dd | Standard Unix disk duplication utility for raw imaging |
| dcfldd | DoD Computer Forensics Laboratory enhanced version of dd with hashing |
| dc3dd | Another forensic dd variant from the DoD Cyber Crime Center |
| sha256sum | SHA-256 hash calculation for integrity verification |
| blockdev | Linux command to set block device read-only mode |
| hdparm | Drive identification and parameter reporting |
| smartctl | S.M.A.R.T. data retrieval for drive health and identification |
| lsblk | Block device enumeration and identification |

## Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Acquiring a Suspect Laptop Hard Drive**
Connect the drive via a Tableau T35u hardware write-blocker, identify as `/dev/sdb`, use dcfldd with SHA-256 hashing, split into 4GB segments for DVD archival, verify hashes match, document in case notes.

**Scenario 2: Imaging a USB Flash Drive from a Compromised Workstation**
Use software write-blocking with `blockdev --setro`, acquire with dcfldd including MD5 and SHA-256 dual hashing, image is small enough for single file, verify and store on encrypted case drive.

**Scenario 3: Remote Acquisition Over Network**
Use dd piped through netcat or ssh for remote acquisition: `ssh root@remote "dd if=/dev/sda bs=4096" | dd of=remote_image.dd bs=4096`, hash both ends independently to verify transfer integrity.

**Scenario 4: Acquiring from a Failing Drive**
Use `ddrescue` first to recover readable sectors, then use dd with `conv=noerror,sync` to fill gaps with zeros, document which sectors were unreadable in the error log.
