## Recommendations
1. Prioritize detections for the top 10 techniques used by sector-targeting groups
2. Conduct threat-informed red team exercises mimicking identified actors
3. Join sector ISAC for real-time threat sharing
4. Implement controls for identified initial access vectors
5. Review supply chain security posture for sector-specific risks

## Validation Criteria

- Sector-specific threat actors identified and profiled
- Common techniques across actors analyzed and ranked
- Attack vectors mapped for the target sector
- Emerging threats identified based on recent intelligence
- Comprehensive sector threat report generated
- Recommendations actionable for security investment decisions
