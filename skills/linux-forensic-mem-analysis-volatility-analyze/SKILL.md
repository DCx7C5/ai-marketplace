---|------------|
| **Memory Forensics** | Analysis of volatile memory (RAM) contents to identify running processes, network connections, and in-memory artifacts that may not exist on disk |
| **Process Hollowing** | Malware technique of creating a legitimate process in suspended state, replacing its memory with malicious code, then resuming execution |
| **Malfind** | Volatility plugin detecting injected code by identifying memory regions with executable permissions and PE headers in non-image VADs |
| **VAD (Virtual Address Descriptor)** | Windows kernel structure tracking memory regions allocated to a process; anomalies in VADs indicate injection or hollowing |
| **EPROCESS** | Windows kernel structure representing a process; rootkits unlink EPROCESS entries to hide processes from standard tools |
| **Pool Tag Scanning** | Memory forensics technique scanning for kernel object pool tags to find objects (processes, files, connections) even when unlinked |
| **Fileless Malware** | Malware that operates entirely in memory without creating files on disk; only detectable through memory forensics |

## Tools & Systems

- **Volatility 3**: Open-source memory forensics framework supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS memory analysis with plugin architecture
- **WinPmem**: Memory acquisition tool for Windows systems that creates raw memory dumps for offline analysis
- **LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)**: Loadable kernel module for capturing Linux system memory dumps
- **Rekall**: Alternative memory forensics framework with some unique analysis capabilities (discontinued but still useful)
- **MemProcFS**: Memory process file system allowing mounting memory dumps as file systems for intuitive analysis

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Detecting Fileless Malware After EDR Alert

**Context**: EDR detected suspicious PowerShell activity but the threat actor cleaned up disk artifacts. A memory dump was captured before the system was rebooted. The analysis needs to identify the malware, its persistence mechanism, and any lateral movement.

**Approach**:
1. Run `windows.pstree` to identify the process chain (which process spawned PowerShell)
2. Run `windows.malfind` to detect injected code in running processes
3. Dump the suspicious process memory and extract strings for C2 URLs
4. Run `windows.netscan` to identify network connections from the compromised processes
5. Run `windows.cmdline` to see what commands PowerShell executed
6. Scan with YARA rules for known malware families in the dumped process memory
7. Extract credentials with `hashdump` and `lsadump` to assess lateral movement risk

**Pitfalls**:
- Using the wrong symbol tables for the OS version (causes plugin failures or incorrect results)
- Not comparing `pslist` vs `psscan` output (missing rootkit-hidden processes)
- Ignoring legitimate processes that have been injected into (focus on malfind results, not just process names)
- Not extracting full process memory before concluding analysis (strings from process dump may reveal additional IOCs)
