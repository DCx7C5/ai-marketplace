| **DEP** | Marks memory pages as non-executable to prevent shellcode execution in data regions |
| **ASLR** | Randomizes memory addresses of loaded modules to defeat hardcoded ROP gadgets |
| **CFG** | Validates indirect call targets at runtime to prevent control flow hijacking |
| **SEHOP** | Validates SEH chain integrity to prevent SEH-based exploitation |

## Tools & Systems
- **Windows Exploit Protection**: Built-in per-process mitigation management
- **EMET (legacy)**: Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (predecessor, now deprecated)
- **ProcessMitigations PowerShell**: Get/Set-ProcessMitigation cmdlets

## Common Pitfalls
- **DEP compatibility**: Legacy 32-bit applications may crash with DEP AlwaysOn. Use OptOut with exceptions.
- **Mandatory ASLR breaking apps**: Some applications are not ASLR-compatible. Test before enforcing ForceRelocateImages.
- **CFG limited to compiled-in support**: CFG only works for applications compiled with /guard:cf. Cannot be retroactively applied.
