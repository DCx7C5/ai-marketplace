description: - When implementing or upgrading remote access architecture for OT environments - When onboarding vendors who require remote access to OT systems for support and maintenance - When implementing CIP-005-7 R2 requirements for remote access management including MFA - When replacing legacy direct VPN access to OT networks with a secure jump server arch
domain: cybersecurity

---|------------|
| Intermediate System | System in the DMZ that terminates external connections and brokers new connections to OT, preventing direct network access per CIP-005 |
| Jump Server | Hardened bastion host in the DMZ used for remote access sessions to OT systems with session recording and access controls |
| Session Recording | Capture of all remote access session activity (screen, keystrokes, commands) for security audit and incident investigation |
| Privileged Access Management (PAM) | System for vaulting credentials, controlling access, and auditing privileged sessions to critical OT systems |
| Co-Attendance | Requirement for an OT operator to monitor vendor remote access sessions in real time |
| Time-Limited Access | Vendor accounts enabled only for specific maintenance windows and automatically disabled after the window closes |

## Tools & Systems

- **CyberArk Privileged Access Security**: Enterprise PAM with session management, credential vaulting, and recording for OT remote access
- **BeyondTrust Privileged Remote Access**: Purpose-built remote access solution with session recording and granular access policies
- **Claroty Secure Remote Access (SRA)**: OT-specific remote access solution with protocol-aware session controls
- **Duo Security**: MFA provider supporting push notifications, hardware tokens, and biometrics for OT access verification
