---|------------|
| CASB | Cloud Access Security Broker - intermediary enforcing security policies between users and SaaS applications |
| SSPM | SaaS Security Posture Management - continuous monitoring of SaaS application security configurations |
| OAuth Governance | Review and control of third-party application permissions granted through OAuth consent flows |
| Session Controls | Real-time access restrictions (block downloads, DLP inspection, watermarking) applied during active SaaS sessions |
| Shadow IT | Unauthorized SaaS applications used by employees without IT approval or security review |
| Conditional Access | Policy engine evaluating identity, device, location, and risk signals before granting SaaS access |

## Tools & Systems

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**: CASB providing shadow IT discovery, session controls, DLP, and SSPM
- **Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access**: Policy engine for identity-based access control to SaaS applications
- **Netskope CASB**: Cloud-native CASB with inline and API-based SaaS security controls
- **Okta Identity Governance**: OAuth app governance and access certification for SaaS applications
- **SSPM Tools**: AppOmni, Adaptive Shield, Valence Security for SaaS configuration monitoring

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Securing Microsoft 365 and Salesforce for 1,000-User Organization

**Context**: A professional services firm with 1,000 users uses Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Slack, and 20+ other SaaS apps. Several data breaches in the industry drive a zero trust initiative for all SaaS access.

**Approach**:
1. Federate all SaaS authentication through Entra ID with SAML SSO
2. Create conditional access policies requiring MFA + compliant device for all SaaS apps
3. Deploy Defender for Cloud Apps for shadow IT discovery (identify 150+ unauthorized apps)
4. Mark unauthorized apps as unsanctioned and block via SWG/proxy
5. Configure session controls: block downloads on unmanaged devices, DLP for file uploads
6. Review OAuth app permissions: revoke 45 high-risk consent grants, enable admin approval workflow
7. Enable SSPM monitoring for Microsoft 365 and Salesforce configurations
8. Set up weekly automated posture reports for security leadership

**Pitfalls**: Conditional access policies need break-glass exclusions. Some legacy SaaS apps may not support modern authentication. Session controls require proxy-based CASB which can impact performance. OAuth app revocation may break integrations; coordinate with app owners first.
