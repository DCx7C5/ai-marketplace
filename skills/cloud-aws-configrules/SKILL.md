---|------------|
| AWS Config Rule | A compliance check that evaluates whether AWS resource configurations meet specified requirements, either continuously or on a schedule |
| Managed Rule | AWS-provided pre-built Config rule with standardized logic for common compliance checks like encryption and public access |
| Custom Rule | Organization-specific Config rule backed by a Lambda function that evaluates custom compliance logic |
| Remediation Action | SSM Automation document or Lambda function triggered to automatically fix non-compliant resources |
| Configuration Aggregator | AWS Config feature that collects compliance data from multiple accounts and regions into a centralized view |
| Conformance Pack | Collection of Config rules and remediation actions packaged as a deployable unit for specific compliance frameworks |

## Tools & Systems

- **AWS Config**: Continuous configuration recording and compliance evaluation service for AWS resources
- **SSM Automation**: AWS Systems Manager documents for executing automated remediation actions on non-compliant resources
- **Config Conformance Packs**: Pre-built rule collections for CIS, PCI DSS, NIST 800-53, and HIPAA compliance
- **CloudFormation StackSets**: Multi-account deployment mechanism for Config rules across AWS Organizations
- **Config Aggregator**: Cross-account and cross-region compliance data consolidation

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Deploying CIS Compliance Monitoring Across 30 AWS Accounts

**Context**: A financial services company needs to demonstrate continuous CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark compliance across all 30 production accounts for their annual SOC 2 audit.

**Approach**:
1. Enable AWS Config recording in all accounts via CloudFormation StackSets
2. Deploy the CIS conformance pack to all accounts using StackSets
3. Set up a Config aggregator in the security account for organization-wide visibility
4. Configure auto-remediation for safe-to-fix rules (public S3, unencrypted volumes)
5. Create EventBridge rules to alert on new NON_COMPLIANT evaluations
6. Build a weekly compliance report aggregating scores across all accounts
7. Store Config snapshots in S3 with lifecycle policies for audit retention

**Pitfalls**: Config recording incurs costs per configuration item recorded. In accounts with many resources, costs can be significant. Use targeted recording groups to focus on compliance-relevant resource types rather than recording all resources. Auto-remediation of network rules (security groups) can disrupt applications if the rule was intentionally permissive.
