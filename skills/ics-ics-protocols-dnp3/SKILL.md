|
| DNP3 | Distributed Network Protocol version 3, the predominant SCADA protocol in the energy sector for communication between masters and outstations |
| Outstation | DNP3 slave device (typically an RTU or IED) that responds to master station polls and commands |
| Select-Before-Operate | DNP3 safety mechanism requiring a Select command before an Operate, preventing accidental control actions |
| Cold Restart (FC 0x0D) | DNP3 command that fully restarts an outstation, resetting all configuration -- a high-risk denial-of-service operation |
| DNP3 Secure Authentication | Optional DNP3 extension (SA v5) adding HMAC-based authentication to prevent command spoofing |
| PIPEDREAM | ICS attack framework with DNP3 capabilities for manipulating outstations and performing firmware updates |
