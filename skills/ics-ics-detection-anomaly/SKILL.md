---|------------|
| Deterministic Traffic | ICS networks exhibit highly predictable communication patterns where the same master polls the same slaves at fixed intervals with identical function codes |
| Isolation Forest | Unsupervised machine learning algorithm that isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning feature space, effective for OT traffic with low anomaly rates |
| Polling Interval | Time between consecutive SCADA master requests to a slave device, typically fixed and configurable (100ms to 10s) |
| Function Code Allowlist | Set of permitted industrial protocol operations for each communication pair, enforced by anomaly detection rules |
| Topology Baseline | Complete map of all authorized device-to-device communication paths in the OT network |
| Physics-Based Detection | Using physical process models (thermodynamics, fluid dynamics) to detect attacks that manipulate the process while spoofing sensor data |
