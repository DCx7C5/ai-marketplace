| VLAN | Virtual Local Area Network - Layer 2 broadcast domain isolation used to separate OT zones on shared switch infrastructure |
| Industrial Firewall | Firewall with deep packet inspection capabilities for industrial protocols (Modbus, DNP3, EtherNet/IP, OPC UA) |
| Data Diode | Hardware-enforced unidirectional gateway that physically prevents reverse data flow, used between OT operations and DMZ |
| Port Security | Switch feature that limits the number of MAC addresses on a port and locks assignments, preventing unauthorized device connections |
| Trunk Port | Switch port carrying multiple VLANs using 802.1Q tagging, used to connect switches and firewalls across zone boundaries |
| DMZ | Demilitarized Zone between enterprise IT and OT - a buffer zone where all cross-domain traffic terminates and is inspected |

## Tools & Systems

- **Cisco ISA-3000**: Industrial security appliance with Modbus, DNP3, and EtherNet/IP deep packet inspection for OT zone firewalls
- **Fortinet FortiGate Rugged Series**: Ruggedized NGFW with OT protocol support and industrial environment certifications
- **Waterfall Security Unidirectional Gateway**: Hardware data diode for enforcing one-way data flow from OT to IT
- **Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches**: Managed switches with VLAN, port security, and industrial protocol support
